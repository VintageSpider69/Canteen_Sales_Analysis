Canteen Sales Analysis
Welcome to the Canteen Sales Analysis project! This repository holds the code and data for a real-world, data-driven exploration of canteen sales trends using Python.

🔍 This project was created as part of a course assignment for my Python programming class.
The prompt was:
"Create a real life application level project using Pandas / Numpy / Matplotlib to perform exploratory analysis of data. Submit in your GitHub by this weekend."

So here it is—polished, pushed, and powered by Pandas.

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes canteen sales data to uncover insights about customer behavior, peak hours, top-selling items, and inventory needs. Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, it provides a beginner-friendly but real-world look at how data analysis works in action.

🔧 Features
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on real-world canteen data

🧮 Statistical summaries using Pandas and NumPy

📈 Visualizations of trends, distributions, and peak periods

🛒 Item popularity insights to guide inventory decisions

🕒 Time-based analysis to identify rush hours
