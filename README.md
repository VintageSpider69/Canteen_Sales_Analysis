# Canteen Sales Analysis

Welcome to the **Canteen Sales Analysis** project! This repository holds the code and data for a real-world, data-driven exploration of canteen sales trends using Python.

> 🔍 **This project was created as part of a course assignment for my Python programming class.**  
> The prompt was:  
> _"Create a real life application level project using Pandas / Numpy / Matplotlib to perform exploratory analysis of data. Submit in your GitHub by this weekend."_

So here it is—polished, pushed, and powered by Pandas.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes canteen sales data to uncover insights about customer behavior, peak hours, top-selling items, and inventory needs. Using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**, it provides a beginner-friendly but real-world look at how data analysis works in action.

## 🔧 Features

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on real-world canteen data  
- 🧮 **Statistical summaries** using Pandas and NumPy  
- 📈 **Visualizations** of trends, distributions, and peak periods  
- 🛒 **Item popularity insights** to guide inventory decisions  
- 🕒 **Time-based analysis** to identify rush hours
